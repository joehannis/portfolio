                I love to use my brain and figure out puzzles. I find a
                collaborative team environment exciting, where everyone is
                coalescing around a problem and sharing knowledge. I love
                learning, and I want a career that is constantly evolving and
                challenging me, as I gain fulfillment from growth.
